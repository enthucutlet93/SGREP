The repository provides a Mathematica package to determine:
a) background solutions,
b) geodesics properties,
c) axial perturbations and GW fluxes sourced by an EMRI;

for a Schwarzschild BH surrounded by a spherically symmetric matter distribution 
following the Einstein cluster prescription. The notebook result_axial.nb contains 
a basic tutorial to use the various functions, for three examples in which the 
matter content is given by a dark matter distribution following the Hernquist, 
the Navarro-Frenk-White, and the Einasto density profiles. Auxiliary files are 
contained within the src folder.
