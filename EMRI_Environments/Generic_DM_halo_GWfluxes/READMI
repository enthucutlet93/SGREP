THE REPOSITORY PROVIDES A MATHEMATICA PACKAGE TO DETERMINE a) BACKGROUND SOLUTIONS, b) 
GEODESICS PROPERTIES, c) AXIAL PERTURBATIONS AND GW FLUXES SOURCED BY AN EMRI; FOR A 
SCHWARZSCHILD BH SURROUNDED BY A SPHERYCALLY SPHERICALLY MATTER DISTRIBUTION FOLLOWING 
THE EINSTEIN CLUSTER PRESCRIPTION.

THE NOTEBOOK result_axial.nb CONTAINS A BASIC TUTORIAL TO USE THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS, 
FOR THREE EXAMPLES, IN WHICH THE MATTER CONTENT IS GIVEN BY A DARK MATTER DISTRIBUTION 
FOLLOWING THE HERNQUIST, THE NAVARRO-FRENK-WHITE AND THE EINSASTO DENSITY PROFILE. 
AUXILIARY FILES ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE src FOLDER.
