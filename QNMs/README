THE REPOSITORY PROVIDEs THE QUASI NORMAL MODE FREQUENCIES 
OF RINGING BLACK HOLES, PARAMETRIZED IN TERMS OF GENERIC DEVIATIONS 
FROM THE (SLOWLY ROTATING-) SCHWARZSCHILD CASE

DATA IN THE REPOSITORY

++ data_QNM.zip [from Phys. Rev. D. 92 083014 (2019)]

Quasi Normal mode frequencies to be used as a basis for generic 
uncoupled scalar/vector/tensor perturbations of non-rotating black 
holes in modified gravity theories. General Relativity corrections 
are assumed to be small deviations of Einstein's theory

Quasi Normal mode frequencies for generic coupled scalar/vector/tensor 
perturbations of non-rotating black holes in modified gravity theories. 
We also provide quadratic corrections to the uncoupled perturbations.
