The MATHEMATICA file contains equations describing axial and polar perturbations sourced 
by a particle in orbital motion around a non-rotating black hole embedded within a spherycally 
symmetric matter distribution. Perturbations are computed with a two-parameter expansion in terms 
of the binary mass ratio and the ratio between the environmental and the BH densities.
