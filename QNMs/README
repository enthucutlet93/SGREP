The repository provides the quasi-normal mode frequencies of ringing black holes, 
parametrized in terms of generic deviations from the (slowly rotating) Schwarzschild case.

DATA IN THE REPOSITORY

++ data_QNM.zip

Quasi Normal mode frequencies to be used as a basis for generic 
uncoupled scalar/vector/tensor perturbations of non-rotating black 
holes in modified gravity theories. General Relativity corrections 
are assumed to be small deviations of Einstein's theory

Quasi Normal mode frequencies for generic coupled scalar/vector/tensor 
perturbations of non-rotating black holes in modified gravity theories. 
We also provide quadratic corrections to the uncoupled perturbations.
